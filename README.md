# Simple Crud App Building


### Technologies We're Practicing With:
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Our backend framework for the server, routers, middleware design pattern.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - We'll be using MongoDB Atlas as our cloud database for storing and managing data.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - To populate our own data and building queries using its schema-based model structure.
- [Vanilla JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - We'll be using vanilla JS to set up our frontend using DOM manipulation.

# Instructions
---
Fork this repo to practice on your own!

- Once you have it open, please create your own branch using `git checkout -b <insert branch name>`
- From there, you will have the same copy of the files on your own new branch.
- To ensure it's backed up, please push your new branch onto the repo: `git push origin <your branch>`
- You're doing this because it's good to practice managing branches.
- To switch back to `main` branch, just simply do `git checkout main`.
- (Optional) If you want to delete your second branch, you can do `git branch -D <your branch name>`
- By reading this next step, you are now in your own branch and ready to dive in. You will notice the `package.json` is already provided. It seems there might be already dependencies included. What do you need to do to make sure you also have these dependencies installed?
- Once you have the packages installed, feel free to explore the rest of the files.
- The goal is make a simple CRUD app if your own design. It can be about anything.
- The files are placed for you based on my preference.
- This is based on using mongoDB and mongoose since it's easier to learn.
- I'm not making any more boilerplate. You're not a baby anymore! Good luck :D
